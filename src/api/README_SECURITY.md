# Security Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation provides comprehensive security features for the Rust web API including CORS validation, rate limiting, referer validation, session management, and security headers.

## Quick Start

The security features are now integrated into the main application. To enable them:

1. Copy the environment configuration:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Customize security settings in `.env`:
```bash
# Set your allowed origins
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,http://localhost:5173

# Adjust rate limits as needed
RATE_LIMIT_SESSION=10
RATE_LIMIT_READ=200  
RATE_LIMIT_WRITE=50

# Enable strict referer validation
STRICT_REFERER=true
```

3. Run the server:
```bash
cargo run
```

The server will now use the secure router with all security middleware enabled.

## Features Implemented

✅ **CORS Configuration**
- Origin validation against whitelist
- Preflight request handling  
- Configurable headers and methods

✅ **Rate Limiting**
- In-memory IP-based rate limiting
- Different limits per endpoint type
- Automatic cleanup of old entries
- Rate limit headers in responses

✅ **Referer Validation**
- Validates referer header for state-changing operations
- Configurable strict mode
- Exempts health check endpoints

✅ **Session Management**
- Cryptographically secure session ID generation
- Automatic session creation for new browsers
- Secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)

✅ **Security Headers**
- Comprehensive set of security headers
- HSTS with configurable max-age
- Content Security Policy
- XSS and clickjacking protection

✅ **Request Limits**
- Configurable request size limits
- Request timeout protection

## Architecture

The security implementation follows a layered middleware approach:

```
Request → Rate Limiting → CORS → Referer → Cookies → Session → Headers → Application
```

Each layer can independently accept or reject requests, with proper error responses and logging.

## Configuration Options

All security settings are configurable via environment variables:

- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: Comma-separated list of allowed origins
- `RATE_LIMIT_*`: Rate limiting configuration
- `STRICT_REFERER`: Enable/disable strict referer validation  
- `COOKIE_MAX_AGE`: User identification cookie expiration (1 year default)
- `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`: Maximum request processing time
- `MAX_REQUEST_SIZE`: Maximum request body size
- `HSTS_MAX_AGE`: HSTS header max-age value

See `.env.example` for the complete list with defaults.

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- ✅ In-memory rate limiting (suitable for single instance)
- ✅ Secure session management
- ✅ Comprehensive input validation
- ✅ Security headers for browser protection

### Production Recommendations
- Use HTTPS in production
- Configure rate limiting for your expected load
- Monitor security logs for suspicious activity
- Consider distributed rate limiting for multi-instance deployments
- Regularly review and update security policies

### Known Limitations
- Rate limiting is per-instance (not shared across multiple server instances)
- Relies on proxy headers for IP detection (ensure proper proxy configuration)

## Testing

Basic compilation and functionality tests are included. For production deployment:

1. Test rate limiting behavior under load
2. Verify CORS configuration with your frontend
3. Validate security headers in browser developer tools
4. Monitor logs for security events

## Monitoring

The implementation logs security events at different levels:
- `INFO`: Normal security events (session creation, etc.)
- `WARN`: Security violations and blocked requests  
- `DEBUG`: Detailed security flow information

For production, use: `RUST_LOG=warn,word_game_backend=info`

## Health Check

A `/health` endpoint is available for monitoring and load balancer health checks. This endpoint bypasses rate limiting and referer validation.
